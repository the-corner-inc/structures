# app

Contains the main application logic, modules, and features. This is where most of the code for your Angular app lives.

- `core/`: Cross-cutting concerns and singleton services.
- `shared/`: Reusable components, directives, and pipes.
- `features/`: Feature modules such as authentication and dashboard.
- `app.component.*`: Root component files for the application.
