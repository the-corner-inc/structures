# `/scripts`

Scripts to perform various build, install, analysis, etc operations.

These scripts keep the root level Makefile small and simple (e.g., [`terraform/Makefile`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/main/Makefile)).

See the [`/scripts`](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout/tree/master/scripts) directory for examples.
