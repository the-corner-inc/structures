Runs a coding agent in a local project workspace.

## Responsibilities

- Load the task, project instructions, and relevant context.
- Send the conversation and available tools to the model.
- Execute permitted tool calls and return their results to the model.
- Continue until the task is complete, blocked, or reaches a configured limit.

## Runtime choices

| Setting | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace | Current project directory |
| Tools | Read files, edit files, run project checks |
| Permissions | Workspace edits allowed; publishing requires approval |
| Limits | Set a time or cost budget for each run |
| Session state | Save progress and tool results for resuming work |

## Completion

Report the changed files, checks run, and any remaining work. Keep credentials outside prompts and logs.

## Installation

Install through your agent app's supported plugin mechanism. Configure the issue tracker connection and grant only the access the workflow needs.

## Usage

Ask the agent to review a change against its linked issue. Enable only the bundled capabilities needed for the project.

## Maintenance

Document the supported host version, required configuration, and changes in each release. Keep secrets outside the package.

Review a proposed change for correctness, security, and maintainability.

## Inputs

- The diff and the intended behavior.
- Relevant project instructions and test commands.

## Working approach

1. Read the changed code and its callers.
2. Trace failure cases and check assumptions against the implementation.
3. Run focused checks using the available tools.

## Tools and scope

Read files, search code, and run checks. Recommend fixes; leave source edits to the implementation task.

## Output

For each actionable finding, include its location, impact, and a concrete correction. If none are found, state what was reviewed and any verification gaps.

| Resource | Project overview | Provide reference content |
| Prompt | Summarize an issue | Supply a reusable prompt template |

## Connection

Document the local launch command or remote endpoint, supported transport, and authentication setup. Add the server through your host's MCP configuration.

## Access

Start with read-only access. Keep credentials in the host's secret storage and enforce authorization on the server.

## Verification

Connect from an MCP client, list the capabilities, and run a sample documentation search. Return a clear error when authentication fails or a resource is unavailable.

Save this in a skill directory supported by your agent app.

\`\`\`markdown
---
name: review-changes
description: Review a code diff for bugs and missing validation. Use for code review requests.

# Review changes

1. Read the diff, project instructions, and affected callers.
2. Check behavior, edge cases, and access controls.
3. Run the relevant project checks.
4. Report actionable findings with file locations and impact.
\`\`\`

## Supporting material

Add reference documents or scripts only when the workflow needs them. Link to them from SKILL.md so the agent knows when to load them.

Shared expectations for work in this project.

## Scope

Apply these conventions to project changes. Store them in a location your agent app reads, such as its project instruction settings or AGENTS.md.

## Implementation

- Read the relevant code before editing.
- Reuse existing helpers and dependencies.
- Keep changes focused on the requested behavior.
- Preserve accessibility and validate external inputs.

## Verification

Run the checks relevant to the change. Report failing or unavailable checks accurately.

## Communication

Summarize the result, verification, and unresolved decisions. Reference changed files when useful.

## Permissions

Use the host's permission controls to restrict actions. Written guidance alone is not an access-control mechanism.

## Behavior

Validate the query and search only authorized project documents. Return an empty result list when nothing matches, and a clear error when the index cannot be reached.

## Integration

Expose the operation as a native host tool or through an MCP server. Describe its inputs and results so the agent knows when to use it.

    readme: `# Post-edit validation hook

Run a project check after an edit completes.

## Trigger

Use the host's supported post-tool event and match its file-editing tools. Event names and matching rules are host-specific.

## Handler

Run from the project root. For a project with a lint script, the command could be:

\`\`\`sh
pnpm lint
\`\`\`

## Failure behavior

Return the check output to the agent and report a nonzero exit status when validation fails. A post-edit hook reports a problem after the edit; it does not undo the change.

## Configuration

Document the event, matcher, working directory, and timeout. Use the host's documented rules if a pre-action hook must block execution.

## Verification

Make one valid edit and one intentionally invalid edit in a disposable workspace. Confirm that the hook runs and exposes the failure.

  readme: `# Prompt

A prompt starts or continues an interaction with an agent. It tells the agent what you need and can provide the information needed to do the work.

## Prompt, instructions, and context

| Concept | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prompt | The input given to the agent | Review this change. |
| Instructions | Guidance on how to work | Prioritize correctness and accessibility. |
| Context | Background that helps with the task | This project uses React 19. |

A single prompt can include all three. Project instructions such as AGENTS.md can also provide guidance across many tasks.

## Example prompt

\`\`\`text
Review the proposed login-page change.

Context: this project uses React 19, and the page must work with a keyboard.
Instructions: check correctness and accessibility. Do not edit files.
Output: list actionable findings with file locations and suggested fixes.

## Writing a useful prompt

State the task, include relevant context, and describe the expected result. Add examples or constraints when they help clarify what you need.

## Project

A TypeScript web application. Keep changes focused and follow patterns in neighboring files.

- Install dependencies: pnpm install
- Start development: pnpm dev
- Check code: pnpm lint
- Run tests: pnpm test
- Build: pnpm build

## Conventions

- Reuse existing components before adding new ones.
- Validate inputs at system boundaries.
- Keep interactive controls keyboard-accessible.
- Do not edit generated files directly.

## Before finishing

Run relevant checks and summarize the changes. State any checks that could not run.

Read CONTEXT.md for current architecture and decisions. Treat its progress notes as background; verify them against the code.

## Project overview

A documentation website for exploring project organization standards.

## Architecture

- Routes define the public pages.
- Shared components render navigation and Markdown.
- Local content supplies the examples shown in the interface.

## Decisions

- Reuse the existing Markdown renderer for all example documents.
- Keep public documentation available without an account.

## Current state

- Completed: initial page layout and navigation.
- Next: review the example content with the team.
- Open question: which examples should be added next?

## Handoff

- Last verified: [date and commit].
- Checks run: [commands and results].
- Known limitations: [remaining issues or assumptions].

Keep these notes current and link to the source files behind each decision. Load this file explicitly or reference it from the project's agent instructions.
