- Provides custom issue and pull request templates for contributors
- Manages repository-level settings and community health files (e.g., `CODEOWNERS`, `FUNDING.yml`)

## Example Files

- `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` — Template for pull requests
- `CODEOWNERS` — Specifies code owners for different parts of the repository
