# Structures

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)  

**Structures** is an open-source Angular platform by [The Corner](https://github.com/thecorner-inc) designed to help teams **visualize, document, and share project organization standards** — starting with folder structures.

---

## Overview

Modern development teams often struggle to keep their **project organization** consistent and understandable — especially when onboarding new members or collaborating across roles.

**Structure** solves that by offering an **interactive, VS Code–like interface** where you can:

- 🗂️ Explore a project’s folder structure visually  
- 💬 Hover files and folders to see their purpose  
- 🧭 Understand how everything connects  
- 💾 Save and share structures (via JSON, later online)  

---

## Current Focus — *Folders for Angular*

The first version focuses on **Angular folder structures**, letting you:

- See an opinionated best-practice folder setup  
- Read contextual explanations for each file/folder  
- Explore an intuitive VS Code–inspired UI  
- Prepare for full customization and export (coming soon)

Later, other frameworks will follow: **React**, **Vue**, **NestJS**, and more.
