# `src`

> The `src` folder is the heart of any Angular application. It contains all the source code, configuration, and assets needed to build and run your app.


## Purpose

All Angular development happens inside `src`. It is the core structure for your application's logic, UI, and configuration. Keeping your code organized here ensures maintainability and scalability as your project grows.
