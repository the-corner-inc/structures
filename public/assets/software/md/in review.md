# In Review
The In Review board is designated for issues that have been completed and are awaiting review or approval. This stage allows team members or stakeholders to assess the work done, provide feedback, and ensure that the deliverables meet the required standards.

## Success
If the review is successful, the issue can then be transitioned to the "Deliverable" or "Done" board, indicating that the task has been finalized and is ready for deployment or release.

## Revisions Needed
If the review identifies any issues or areas for improvement, the issue may be sent back to the "In Progress" board for further work.
