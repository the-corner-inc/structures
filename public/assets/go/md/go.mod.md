## What is go.mod?

The `go.mod` file is a key part of Go (Golang) projects. It defines the moduleâ€™s path and manages its dependencies, enabling reproducible builds by specifying the exact versions of required packages. The `go.mod` file is created when you run `go mod init` in your project directory.

### Example

```go
module github.com/username/projectname

go 1.21

require (
	github.com/gin-gonic/gin v1.9.0
	github.com/sirupsen/logrus v1.9.0
)
```

#### Exmplanation
- `module` declares the module path.
- `go` specifies the Go version.
- `require` lists dependencies and their versions.
