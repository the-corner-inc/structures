# Backlog
The Backlog board is a collection of issues that are yet to be prioritized or scheduled for development. It serves as a repository for tasks, features, and bug fixes that need to be addressed for the future sprint. Team members can review and organize these issues during planning sessions to determine their importance and urgency.
